DecisionMakerApp
================

Randomly selects an item from a custom list (input by user). My first Android app.

Currently working on:
<ul>
  <li>
  Add simpler, 2-item selector to show by default and when press clear list button. Possibly use another listview and overlay it, just toggle visibility on one or the other.
  </li>
  <li>
  Implement ViewHolder
  </li>
</ul>
